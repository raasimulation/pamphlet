        const text = `Returning to the umwelt of the post-internet city, home of billions of human residents, we might ask: how are
        digital media reshaping human perception? How does this communicative shift drive new communities of sensation,
        attention, and engagement? While all organisms respond in some way or another to ecological transformations in
        their surroundings, the mutation of the social and cultural landscape through a proliferation of digital modes
        of interaction begs the question of human adaptation. For millennia, the plasticity of the human brain has
        enabled adaptation alongside shifting environmental conditions. In hypermediated environments characterized by
        carefully calibrated sensory stimuli, the plasticity of the brain is not only exercised, it is capitalized.
        Competing agencies profit from the capacity to shape perceptions towards particular ends and benefit from the
        tendency of the brain to iteratively mold itself in response to shifting strategies of inculcation. In the
        global ecology of attention instantiated by the post-internet city, what should designers do with the brainâ€”both
        theirs and ours?`;
